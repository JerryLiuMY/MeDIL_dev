Real experiments -- reuse the same samples for real experiments
Real dataset â€”- distributional assumptions
Image dataset and matrix factorization datasets

How much do we loss using the heuristic solver
Real dataset check -- 10 columns
Changing the alpha will improve the results -- increase alphas will converge to Vanilla VAE
Not sensitive after a particular value of alpha -- preserve the structure but good loss

Graph degeneracy
Convolutional layers
Implicit regularization
Write-up of the experiments for VAE
Causal VAE and Causal GAN paper write-up
