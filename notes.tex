Real experiments -- reuse the same samples for real experiments
Real dataset â€”- distributional assumptions
Image dataset and matrix factorization datasets

heuristic algorithm
graphs fix the structure -- 10 columns
real dataset check

changing the alpha will improve the results -- increase alphas will converge to Vanilla VAE
(not sensitive after a particular value of alpha -- preserve the structure but good loss)
how much do we loss using the heuristic solver
real data experiments
graph degeneracy

Convolutional layers
Implicit regularization
Write-up of the experiments for VAE
Causal VAE and Causal GAN paper write-up
