Reconstruction error
Performance on different replicates
Keep the sparsity but introduce some misalignment
Save the results after each replicate -- as often as possible

Training and validation
Three alpgorithms
Real experiments -- reuse the same samples for real experiments

Change alpha / Heuristic solver

Real dataset â€”- distributional assumptions
Image dataset and matrix factorization datasets

Convolutional layers
Implicit regularization

Write-up of the experiments for VAE
Causal VAE and Causal GAN paper write-up


4 algorithms (vanilla, exact MeDIL, heurstic MeDIL, oracle MeDIL)
rerun the entire pipeline -- including MeDIL 10 replicates
10 toy fixed graphs (a)-(i)
10 random graphs -- save the graphs and similar complexity
10 real data -- randomly 10 columns
more experiments on the random graph
sample size n=12...2500 -- single dataset for both MeDIL training and VAE (10 different values)
~2 hours

alpha = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9
~12 hours

output data
save the log-file to dropbox as the program is running

exact vs. heuristic / the optimal value of alpha
