Real experiments -- reuse the same samples for real experiments
Real dataset â€”- distributional assumptions
Image dataset and matrix factorization datasets

10 toy fixed graphs (a)-(i)
10 random graphs -- save the graphs and similar complexity
10 real data -- randomly 10 columns
more experiments on the random graph
sample size n=12...2500
alpha = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9

exact vs. heuristic / the optimal value of alpha

Convolutional layers
Implicit regularization
